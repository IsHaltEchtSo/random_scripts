## PURPOSE

The purpose of this repository is to experiment with different ideas and libraries in python to arrive at a holistic understanding 
of what is feasible with programming and what is not. The experiments may be completely unrelated or sequentially. I can't guarantue
a coherent way to display which is which but I'll try to bring structure into this repository time to time.
